alt="Bus stop"><span id='opening'>Many great stories could be told about the group of young kids who lived in a secluded corner of Whistler around the street of Barnfield.</span> Sandwiched between Blueberry Hill and Alta Lake, this area was routinely terrorized by me and my friends. Some fun tales include us damming the creek underneath the road, or going out and doing donuts in the snow with my friend’s old Honda when we were 12.  However, if there’s one story I remember the most, it would have to be the time we allegedly broke a bus window. During the winter, us kids always built forts in the large snow banks and snow dumps that littered our neighborhood. On the day in question we had decided to build some snow forts along the side of the main road. They were located just before the loop where the local bus stopped and turned around. From this spot we were often tempted to throw snowballs at passing cars. Unfortunately for us though, quite a few people driving by would know our parents, so we didn't risk throwing snow at them.. Therefore, we decided to only throw snow at the bus. This meant that, every half hour, we would line up in our little forts hidden from the road, and chuck as many snowballs as possible at the passing bus. This process would repeat every half hour from morning until nightfall. <br><br> By the time night did come around, only two of us were still out there manning the forts, my friend’s brother Nicky, and me. At about 6:00, by which time it was pitch black out, Nickey and I decided to call it a night and head home. This was when we made our mistake. Right before we were leaving, Nicky decided to throw just one more snowball at a passing car. The darkness would, in theory, give us great cover to escape if that person got out of their car. We waited until we saw headlights, then Nicky grabbed a snowball and threw it at this car (A perfect strike right on the door I might add). Now, if this had been any random car driving down the road I probably wouldn't be telling this story. But we had just so happened to hit the car of the transit officer who had been sent to deal with the disturbance we had been making. The officier wheeled his car around the loop, pulled up along our snowbank, rolled down his window, and started yelling at us to come out. Meanwhile, we hid silently behind the snowbank. Eventually Nicky caved and popped his head above the snowbank, probably expecting me to do the same. However, being a good friend, I decided to make a run for it. I used the cover of the snow bank to run, undetected, to the next street corner. From there I ran as fast as I could, while wearing snow gear, back to my house. When I got home I, of course, thought that I had got away scot free; and for a few minutes it looked like I had. <br><br> Then the phone rang. As it turned out, I had, pretty obviously, not managed to get out of trouble. Nickey, whom I had abandoned, lived pretty much right next to the snowbank we were using, so making a run home didn’t really work for him. The phone call was from Nicky’s mother, who had been told by the officer to round up all the kids in the neighborhood who had thrown snow at the bus. My dad, after hearing this, practically dragged me down the street to their house. When we got there all my friends and their parents were waiting. The officer proceeded to inform us that we had broken a window on the bus earlier in the day (Most of us still don’t believe this). He also informed us that we would have to pay for the damages. The damages were supposedly in excess of seven hundred dollars. Looking back on it, this seems pretty cheap considering what we had, allegedly, broken. Although, to a group of pre-teens, who considered a couple hundred dollars the peak of personal wealth, this was quite a scary prospect. The officer left after telling us that leaving me and my friends to trod home with our disappointed parents. Over the next few days we kept worrying about when we would have to cough up our savings, wondering when the transit people would phone our parents or show up again. Gradually those days turned into weeks, which  turned into months, and eventually we forgot about ever having to pay any fine. Maybe the idea of a fine was just to scare us; to make sure we never threw snowballs at the bus again? Whatever it was, we never did have to pay any fine, and nowadays, most of my friends don’t even believe we broke a window. Whatever happened, I can tell you that was the last time I ever threw snowballs at vehicles.

alt="Grass field"><span id='opening'>Polemu and his beautiful wife Geneca lived on a high mountain called Mt. Voumu.</span> Stretching up into the sky, it touched the highest clouds and reached for the brightest stars in the night sky! The year was 1678 BC and life was good for these two souls. Polemu and Geneca were sitting on the balcony, raking beyond the big gate to the entry of their palace. A big wooden sign raked above the gate. “Pochni Meagalos Kolo'' was written on it with golden edges around the big red letters. In the shivered shine of the moon light, Polemu revealed what Geneca already knew for days. “ I need to go fight again. I promise I won't be long, but the Battle of Mochi cannot wait. I am sorry“ Polemu said slowly. He knew that his wife had never wanted him to go to war. “Please make sure you come back to me” Geneca pleaded to her love. “I promise to always come back to you my dear Geneca” Polemu assured her. With one final embrace Polemu left his wife and ventured off to war. <br><br> Polemu was a fearless warrior, and was afraid of no one on the battlefield. Leading his men, he charged into battle as he had done countless times before. The fight was bloody and fierce, many men lost their lives, but Polemu soldiered on. His men  continued to push forward conquering field after field, valley after valley. Reacting the final stretch of this droughtful battle he soon ordered his men to overrun the enemy and march forward to the end of the fields at the nearby mountain range. In the final minutes of the battle Polemu looked over his shoulder taking in the scenery of the path of destruction they had left. Just as he turned around again, he felt the sharp pain of a well sharpened arrow piercing through his armor and skin into his flesh. After what felt like an eternity Polemu could feel his warm blood running down the inside of his bronze chest armor. During his fall to the ground Polemu fainted, taking in the last picture his living eyes should ever have seen. One of his loyal generals witnessed Polemu being shot and bursted out into a sharp, long scream of exhaustion and anger. Polemu did not grasp what had happened to him. He had never imagined something like this was possible as he started feeling a strange tickling sensation spread through his entire body. His entire body started to plunge into the ground as if he was being pulled down by the hands of the devil himself. <br><br> As Polemu opened his eyes again he couldn’t believe what was disclosed in front of him. In all the years of traveling and fighting he had never seen nor imagined such a place. He caught sight of a dark chamber, which was only lit up by the fireplaces spread through the entire big hall Polemu found himself in. He felt the emerging heat from the fires on his skin and sweat starting to form between his body and his armor. He swiftly slipped out of the mighty shiny armor he had fought, and, as he himself realized in this moment, died in. Below the armor, that had done nothing to secure his life anyways, Polemu wore a brown long robe that barely revealed his ankles. As Polemu turned around yet once again, he stared into big burning red eyes. Polemu could not tell whether he stared into a reflection of the fires in the strangers eyes, or if the eyes were the shier source of all fire surrounding him. The eyes belonged to a big and narrow face, embossed by a manifold of battle scars. Polemu himself had taken away numerous scars from his battles, as had he seen numberless soldiers with similar fates. But never had he seen so many scars on one's face. Immediately Polemu grabbed to his left,  where he was used to feeling the strong wooden handle of his destructive sword that had saved his life so many times. But stripping off his armor also meant stripping off the sword sheath, usually storing his mighty weapon. As his hand couldn’t find his blade, Polemu realized his fate. Such a powerful and mighty creature could easily kill him without any way of defending himself. In a deep, loud and yet calm voice the stranger started speaking as his voice was echoing back from all corners of the room, „Are you Polemu, the warrior from Mt. Voumu, the soldier that killed so many in countless battles over the years? Are you the husband of Geneca, the one that promised her to always return to her and yet died in battle, killed by an arrow. The Weapon of a fool?“. Polemu lost all willingness to defend himself as he realized who he was speaking to. Hades, the ruler of the empire of the dead. The man he had talked to dozens of times before in his dreams and never taken seriously. The voice in his head telling him not to go to battle, and never go to war again. The only exception Hades had made was the battle of Mochi. He had almost pushed Polemu to go and fight at this rather trivial battle. As Polemu stayed silent, deep in thoughts, the stranger, Hades, spoke again, „I have been trying to reach you for quite some time now.“, he says, once again in an intense and low voice, „We need to talk“. Polemu mumbled to himself, “Talk… With me? Why?“ Hades interrupted him immediately screaming, “YOUUU…YOUU, YOU are the one that killed hundreds, that started battles and ended more lives than anyone else. But you killed too many, don't you realize that with your actions you brought the living and the dead out of balance? This place… My empire, it is bursting at all seams. We do not have enough space to store any of those poor souls you killed.“ In a much calmer voice Hades continued his thought, „I am making you an offer. Take it or suffer from my torture forever. I will grant you a return to the world of the living. To your palace and to your wife. But you must promise to therefore respect my demand and stop the destruction and death once and for all. You will live the rest of your days with your wife and will never kill again.“ Polemu thought about the generous offer for a long time. It must have been at least a couple hours, during which he stumbled through the torch lit halls of Hades´ Empire. He could not understand why Hades had found an interest in someone that unimportant as himself, and still even Polemu could recognize that Hades was serious. Alone the thought of needing to remain in the bleak and dreary place he found himself triggered unexpected emotions in Polemu. Thoughts of his wife crossed his mind and he could only imagine her reaction when she would find out what had happened at the Battle of Mochi. It was then when Polemu realized that staying in the sorrowful hell that Hades called his home, he could never see his beloved wife ever again. Nor could he feel her hands on his cheeks again. He realized that he had never spent enough time with his wife. Polemu had never bothered thinking about death, but in this moment Polemu realized the dependence of love upon life. One could not exist without the other and so Polemu had made his decision. He purposely walked back to where he had met Hades the first time and to his surprise Hades hadn’t moved an inch from where Polemu had left him. Unerringly he spoke, “I have made my decision. I will return to the world of the living once again, and be assured that if I ever break my promise of pacifism, I shall return to this place and serve you for eternity.“Hades seemed to be satisfied with Polem´s decision as he nodded in agreement. Without saying a word Hades snapped his fingers and Polemu immediately felt the pain reemerging where the arrow had hit his neck. <br><br> By the time he opened his eyes the pain had almost completely disappeared again and Polemu found himself in the middle of an empty battlefield, surrounded by corpses of fellow soldiers. Some of the corpses had been taken over by nature and colorful flowers had blossomed over the signs of destruction. What had felt like hours in Hades´ had been days if not weeks in the world of the living. Migrating through the hills of destruction back to his palace and wife, Polemu, for the first time ever, understood the importance of peace. Seeing the horrifying never ending mountains, filled by corpses made him understand Hades and Polemu asked himself whether Hades had planned this all along, sending him to this Battle to witness the inevitable if he remains on earth killing hundreds.Stretching above all hills and mountains he could soon see Mount Voumu and the place he and his wife called home. Polemu had forgotten how majestic it looked raking into the sky. Walking up the stairs to his palace felt surreal to Polemu. He could not remember the last time he had been this excited to see his wife again and so, on his way up Polemu picked a couple flowers and made them into a bundle. Reaching the last step of the staircase Polemu took a second before he slowly but surely knocked on the big wooden gate. Everything had stayed the same during the time of absence and yet everything was different. Polemu was a changed man as his wife opened the door and stared into his empty face. Geneca immediately bursted into tears, as she yelled and screamed at him. After answering all of the questions Geneca had (while skipping his death) Polemu revealed to her his moment of  revelation, seeing all the destruction he had caused on his hike back. While holding his wife in his arms, Polemu vowed what he had already sworn to Hades, he would never go to war again and live his life to the rest of his days with his Wife on their small island of paradise stretching into the sky. Because in the end, <span id='opening'>love conquers all.</span>
